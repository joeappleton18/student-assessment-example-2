                    <h2>What is ThoughtCloud?</h2>
                    <p>ThoughtCloud is a collborative sharing platform for staff from across MAXIMUS UK to share their ideas on how we can improve our business.</p>
                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                    <p>You can submit your own ideas, review and vote on other ideas and respond to our challenges. All ideas and responses are reviewed by the Operational Excellence Panel who will select ideas to progress. If your idea is selected, you could be in for a reward!</p>
                    <h2>Who can submit ideas?</h2>
                    <p>Anyone that works here! All staff are encouraged to put ideas forward, either as individuals or as a team.</p>
                    <h2>There are no bad ideas!</h2>
                    <p>If you have an idea that you think will help, no matter the scale or if you think it may be a little odd, we want to hear from you. Some ideas may not work out, but then you don't get anywhere by not trying!</p>

                <h3>Make a difference</h3>
                <p>We'll take into account the popularity of an idea when deciding which ones to look into further, although well-liked suggestions for 52 weeks paid holiday a year probably still won't get picked - sorry!</p>
